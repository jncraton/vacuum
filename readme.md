Vacuum
======

This lab provides the opportunity to create an automous agent to vacuum virtual houses.

Task
----

Your task is to implement the vacuuming agent such that it is able to successfully vacuum at least houses 0 through 4. Additional houses are provided for an extra challenge and to better measure agent performance in complex environments.

Warning ðŸ”¥: The vacuum hardware is somewhat limited and is unable to run continuously without overheating. There is a sensor to monitor the current `temp`. Make sure that you `rest` occasionally to prevent the device from catching fire.

No code outside of the agent function should be modified in your final submission.

Percepts and Actions
--------------------

The vacuum `agent` processes data from sensors as `percepts` and uses this sensor data to select a valid `action`. The environment then updates based on the `action` and new `percepts` are returned from sensors so the agent can make its next decision.

Handout Code
------------

Handout code [vacuum.py](vacuum.py) is provided and must be used as a starting point for this assignment. Your task is to provide an implementation for the `agent` function.
